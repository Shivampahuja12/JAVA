## 1. Every Method in the class have its own stack and stack contains two columns for key and value respectively.
## 2. Calculator calc = new Calculator(); - here calc is a local variable which is stored in the stack, and the new Calculator is creating an object which is stored in the heap (object have two sections - 1st is where all the instance variables are stored and 2nd one is )
## 3. Object created with new keyword and the members which are declared or initialised in the class are stored in the heap memory (say an object is declared like this - Calculator calc = new Calculator(); - In the Calculator class there i have a instance member and a member function) there both the things instance member and members functions which are declared in the class will be stored in the heap memory having any of the address but the calc(which is declared in the main) is stored in the stack of the main method with the address of the object created by the calc line.
